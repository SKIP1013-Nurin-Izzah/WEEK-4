		/*You are required to calculate the total price that needs to be paid by a customer
		 *  in C_MARTS shopping complex. The program should ask how many items that the 
		 *  customer buys (the maximum number of items is 3).
		 *   Based on the number of items, the program will ask the quantity and price of
		 *    each item. Each time the quantity and price are entered, they must be multiplied
		 *     and totaled up. Then, the program should calculate the discount obtained by the
		 *      customer based on the total price. If the customer buys more than RM100, he/she
		 *       is entitled to a 20% discount, whereas, if the total price is less than RM100
		 *        the customer is only entitled to 10% discount. Finally, the program should
		 *         display the total price before discount, discount received and the amount that
		 *          needs to be paid.*/
